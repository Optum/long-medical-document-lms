Long Medical Document Language Models
Copyright 2022 Optum

Project Description:
====================
This project repository contains code to explain and train language models that extract information from long medical documents or any kind of text data with the Masked Sampling Procedure (MSP).
It provides an implementation of MSP and documentation to help a user fine-tune a long LM from Hugging Face Transformers for document classification and explain the predictions of that model using MSP.
